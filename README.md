# my-Projects

Here will go all the mini-Projects I'm making about Web development (HTML, CSS, JS), and Python. If there is any project interesting I'll create its own directory, and I'll improve it over time. Feel free to watch!

Disclaimer: Some projects have names or comments in Spanish. I'll be changing them in the future. For now use Google translate hehe ðŸ˜Ž
